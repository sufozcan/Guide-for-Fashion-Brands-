# Guide for Fashion Brands: Sales & Revenue Analysis

This project explores how fashion brands can leverage data to optimize their sales strategies and increase revenue using data visualization techniques. 

## Project Overview

Using a dataset containing 18 variables (dimensions and measures) , this research analyzes various factors such as seasonality, location, and customer demographics to provide actionable business insights for clothing brands. 

## Tools & Techniques

Tableau: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards. 

## Data Preprocessing: 

- Handled missing values using IFNULL. 
- Performed outlier detection and duplicate checks. 
- Grouped categorical variables (e.g., merging "bi-weekly" and "fortnightly"). 
- Standardized column naming and data types. 

Statistical Analysis: Calculated descriptive statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation for age and purchase amounts. 

## Key Insights & Business Questions

The analysis seeks to answer 7 critical business questions: 

Age-Based Strategy: Focusing on a specific age group is less effective than catering to item preferences within those groups (e.g., shirts for the 18-35 group vs. jewelry for the 54-70 group). 

Subscription Value: Analysis revealed that non-subscribers (3.8) actually have slightly higher average review ratings than subscribers (3.7) , suggesting a need for brands to enhance subscription privileges. 

Geographic Optimization: By identifying top and bottom-performing states by average purchase amount , brands can optimize store counts and stock levels. 

Inventory & Sizing: Data shows Size M (1,755 purchases) is the most common, while Size XL (429 purchases) is the least , providing a clear roadmap for production weight. 

Seasonal Trends: Using dot plots to visualize item popularity by season helps in planning production and timing discounts for remaining stock.
